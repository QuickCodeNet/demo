### 3.3. Gateway & Portal Dashboards

QuickCode projects include ready-to-use management dashboards for both Gateway and Portal:

- **Gateway Dashboard:**
    - Central entry point for all APIs and modules
    - Health checks, Swagger Map, config management, and quick links to Portal, Kibana, Kafdrop, and GitHub
    - Your project: e.g. [https://demo-gateway.quickcode.net](https://demo-gateway.quickcode.net)
      ![Gateway Dashboard](docs/images/quickcode-gateway-dashboard.png)

- **Portal Dashboard:**
    - Admin interface for managing all tables, users, roles, permissions, and workflows
    - Secure login, user management, and event/workflow configuration
    - Demo user credentials:
        - Username : demo@quickcode.net
        - Password : String1!
    - Your project: e.g. [https://demo-portal.quickcode.net](https://demo-portal.quickcode.net)
      ![Portal Login](docs/images/quickcode-portal-login.png)

These dashboards are automatically deployed and available for every generated project, providing a unified and professional management experience out of the box.

### 3.4. Domain & Routing

All services and modules are deployed to Google Cloud Run and exposed via user-friendly, corporate domains ending with `.quickcode.net` for a seamless and professional experience.

- **Gateway:**
    - link: [https://demo-gateway.quickcode.net](https://demo-gateway.quickcode.net)
- **Portal:**
    - link: [https://demo-portal.quickcode.net](https://demo-portal.quickcode.net)
- **Module APIs:**
    - link: [https://demo-user-manager-module.quickcode.net](https://demo-user-manager-module.quickcode.net)
    - etc.

#### Gateway Routing
- The Gateway automatically routes requests to the correct module API based on the path and host.
- Swagger, health check, and module API endpoints are all mapped and accessible via the Gateway domain.
- All routing and cluster configuration is managed for you; see the sample below:

```json
{
  "Routes": {
    "user-manager-module": {
      "Match": {
        "Hosts": ["demo-gateway.quickcode.net"],
        "Path": "api/user-manager-module/{**catch-all}"
      },
      "ClusterId": "user-manager-module-api"
    }
  },
  "Clusters": {
    "user-manager-module-api": {
      "Destinations": {
        "destination1": {
          "Address": "https://demo-user-manager-module.quickcode.net"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This ensures all APIs and dashboards are accessible via clean, memorable URLs, both in demo and production environments.

### 3.5. Advanced Features

#### Gateway API Monitoring & Kafka Integration
![API Gateway & Monitoring](docs/images/quickcode-gateway-dashboard.png)
- **API Call Tracking:** Every API call passing through the Gateway is monitored and logged
- **Predefined Topics:** Kafka integration with predefined topics for different types of API calls
- **Real-time Monitoring:** Track API performance, usage patterns, and system health
- **Event Streaming:** All API events are streamed to Kafka for real-time processing

#### Custom Workflows with YAML Configuration
![Workflow Editor](docs/images/workflow-editor.png)
- **YAML-based Workflow Definition:** Create custom workflows using simple YAML configuration
- **Endpoint Integration:** Workflows can trigger API calls to any endpoint
- **Topic-based Processing:** Workflows can subscribe to Kafka topics and process events
- **Dynamic Execution:** Workflows can be modified and deployed without code changes

#### User Group-Based Api Management
![Api User Management](docs/images/api-permission-manager.png)
- **Endpoint-Level Permissions:** Configure access control for each API endpoint based on user groups
- **Portal Page Management:** Granular control over portal pages and CRUD operations per user group

## 4. Setup & Run

### 4.1. Quick Start with Docker

**On macOS and Linux:**
```bash
docker compose up --build
```

**On Windows (or older Docker installations):**
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

**Access the services:**
- **Portal:** http://localhost:6020
- **Gateway:** http://localhost:6060

> **Note:** For detailed step-by-step instructions, see the [Onboarding Checklist](#onboarding-checklist) above.

### 4.2. Local Development

- You can run individual modules locally using Visual Studio or `dotnet run`.
- Make sure required environment variables and connection strings are set (see [Environment Variables & Secrets](#71-environment-variables--secrets)).

---

## 5. Running Tests

- **Unit & Integration Tests:**
  ```bash
  dotnet test QuickCode.Demo.docker.sln
  ```
- **Code Coverage:**
  ```bash
  ./run-coverage-report.sh
  ```
  Coverage reports are generated in the `coverage-report/` directory.

  **Note:** The coverage script:
    - Excludes DTOs from coverage (`[*.Dtos]*`)
    - Excludes Common, Portal, and Gateway projects from coverage
    - Generates HTML reports in `coverage-report/index.html`

---

## API Testing with Postman Collections

Ready-to-use Postman collections are provided for all modules in this project. This enables you to quickly test and explore every API endpoint.

### How to Use

1. **Import All Collections:**
    - In Postman, click **Import** and select all JSON files from the `src/postman_files` directory.
    - You will see collections for the **User Manager API** and other modules (such as Email Manager Module, Sms Manager Module , etc.).

2. **Authentication Flow:**
    - Each collection contains an **Authentication** folder with a `Login` request.
    - Run the `Login` request first.
        - The test script in this request will automatically save the `access_token` (or `token`) to your Postman environment.

3. **Environment Setup:**
    - Make sure you have a Postman environment with a `token` variable (it will be set automatically after login).
    - Optionally, set a `baseUrl` variable if your API base URL is different from the default.

4. **Test Any Endpoint:**
    - After logging in, you can immediately test any endpoint in any collection.
    - All requests use the token automatically via the `Authorization: Bearer {{token}}` header.

---

### Example Workflow

1. **Import all collections from `src/postman_files`.**
2. **Select or create a Postman environment.**
3. **Run the `Login` request in the `Authentication` folder of the User Manager API or any other module.**
4. **The token is saved to the environment.**
5. **You can now use all other endpoints in all collections without manually copying tokens.**

---

### Notes

- All collections are automatically generated from the latest Swagger/OpenAPI definitions, ensuring they are always up to date.
- If your token expires or you get a 401 error, simply re-run the `login` request to refresh your token.

---

**This setup makes onboarding, testing, and integration with your APIs fast and reliable for all developers and partners.**

---

## 6. CI/CD & Cloud Run Deployment

- **GitHub Actions** is used for CI/CD.
- On every push or pull request, tests and builds are run automatically.
- On merge to `main`, Docker images are built and pushed to Google Container Registry.
- **Automatic deployment to Google Cloud Run** is triggered after a successful build.
- All secrets and environment variables are managed via **GitHub Secrets** and **GCP environment variables**.
  ![GitHub Actions](docs/images/github-actions.png)

**Example Workflow:**
1. Developer pushes code to GitHub.
2. GitHub Actions runs tests, builds, and coverage.
3. If on `main`, Docker images are built and pushed.
4. Cloud Run is updated with the new image.
5. Health checks and notifications are performed.

---

## 7. Developer Notes & Extras
